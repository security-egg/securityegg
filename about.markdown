		I could introduce myself in many ways. Like, you can find me on <a href="https://app.hackthebox.eu">hackthebox</a> as eggd, on <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">tryhackme</a> as eggofd or on <a href="https://github.com/security-egg">github</a> as security-egg. As for "who I am", well, that's the reason I created security.egg. Currently, I am a student of Informatics and Computer
		Engineering at University of West Attica with a great passion for <span style = "color: #59db57; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black, 0 0 25px green, 0 0 5px darkgreen">cyber security</span>
		 (or cybersecurity, or cyber-security). Still, my studies are not enough for me. I continually seek for more knowledge, more challenges, <del>g1v3_m3_m0r3_fl4gs</del>, more thrills. What can
		I say?<br>I am just an IT security geek...
