One of the most interesting rooms, and just a room but a network, on TryHackMe is the "Wreath Network". What makes it so fascinating is, not just the whole network concept but, the suggestion to make your own Debrief & Report.<br>
I wont say anything else for this room here, as I, finally, made my own Penetration Test Report. Which I am a bit proud of. And I recommend you to try aswell.<br>
